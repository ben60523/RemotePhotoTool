## Compatibility ##

Note that most cameras may work, but due to the fact that I only own an EOS 40D and a Powershot
G9, not all cameras are tested. All tested cameras are marked  `tested and works`. If you want
to report a working camera, test the application with the Test Cases (see below for a link)
and send me a message with the camera infos.
